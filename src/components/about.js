                  Since graduating from the University of the Balearic Islands,
                  he has spent several years conducting research in the field of
                  grapevine physiology under water-limited conditions. His work
                  has focused on comparing the physiological responses of
                  different genotypes, including emblematic Spanish varieties
                  such as Tempranillo, and Garnacha, grafted onto well-known
                  commercial rootstocks such as 110R and 140Ru, as well as newly
                  developed hybrids.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He has published scientific articles in high-impact journals,
                  several of which have been recognized as Highly Cited
                  Articles. His studies have contributed to a deeper
                  understanding of the vulnerability of the grapevine vascular
                  system to drought.
